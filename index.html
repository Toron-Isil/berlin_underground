    <h2>Berlin is built on sandâ€¦</h2>
    <p class="article">The year 1237 is still considered the official year the city was founded,
      as this was the first time C&ouml;lln, the small twin city on the River Spree, was mentioned.
      The first documented mention of Berlin followed in 1244. However, in 2008,
      archaeologists found an oak beam which probably dates back to 1183.
      This would make Berlin 54 years older than previously thought.
      The excavation took place in Petriplatz, one of the oldest areas in Berlin.
      At the end of the 12th century, Berlin developed from the two small merchant
      settlements of Berlin and C&ouml;lln, located on both sides of the Spree,
      into today's district of Mitte. And here we must ask ourselves an important question
      about the founding of Berlin: how was this &quot;Brandenburg sandbox&quot;,
      which was traditionally quite a poor area, able to develop from the two
      rather insignificant small settlements and become what is today - by far -
      the largest German metropolis? It is even more astonishing when one considers
      that this process can only be explained if one understands how the sandy,
      marshy ground was developed for construction and later for the urban supply systems,
      such as the sewage system, the gas, water and power lines or public transport.</p>
